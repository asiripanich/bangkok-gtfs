# bangkok-gtfs

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bangkok-gtfs is to make daily snapshots of Bangkok GTFS accessible to anyone. 
This project started on 26/04/2022. 
Better late than never!

The table below is updated every time there is a new snapshot of GTFS.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gert::git_log(max = 10000000L) %>%
  filter(time == min(time) | grepl("^GTFS snapshot\\n$", message)) %>%
  mutate(download_link = paste0("https://github.com/asiripanich/bangkok-gtfs/tree/", commit, "/data/gtfs")) %>%
  select(time, download_link) %>%
  arrange(-order(time)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
